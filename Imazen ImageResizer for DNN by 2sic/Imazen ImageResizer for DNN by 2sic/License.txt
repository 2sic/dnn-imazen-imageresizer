Most ImageResizer plugins are under the permissive Apache 2 license.

* The Light Bundle *
The light-package only contains work with Apache 2.0 licenses. 


* The Pro Bundle *
The  Pro-Package includes plugins under the copyleft AGPL license. 

This means, if you create anything using the additonal plugins, you must also publish your work as open-source, or purchase a license.

Our work (creating the DNN bundle) is licensed under MIT, but this in not really relevant to most use cases. 
Basically if you're using the Resizer in a fully open source setup and publish your work (AGPL-Style) you can also use the pro-edition for free, otherwise you must get a licenses from Imazen.
